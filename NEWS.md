### Version 1.2.0 Lagerst√§tte

#### New MCMC moves

 * slice sampling (mvSlice) can now do geometric scaling.

#### New models/analyses

 * New codon models:
   * Goldman-Yang (1994), Muse-Gaut (1994), FMutSel (Yang 2008)
   * Create of Codon models using stackable blocks fndNdS, fnX3, fnMutSel, fnMutSelAA
   * i.e. fnMutSel(F, fndNdS(omega, fnX3( fnGTR(er, pi) ) ) # GTR + X3 + dNdS + MutSel
 * New dinucleotide models: fnX2, fnMutSel
   * i.e. fnMutSel(F, fnX2( fnHKY(kappa, nuc_pi) ) )    # HKY + X2 + MutSel
 * New birth death models:
   * Birth death sampling treatment process (Magee et al. 2020)
   * Time-heterogeneous fossilized birth death range process
  
#### Bug fixes

  * fixed occasional crashes when using recovering a tree from a checkpoint file due to rounding. Checkpointing now records doubles without rounding
  * fixed a bug when printing individual elements of average distance matrices and calculating their completeness

#### New features

  * optional weighting in fnAverageDistanceMatrix
  * FBD range model uses individual fossil occurrence data
  * site mixture allocations work with codon models
  * automatic handling of whitespace delimited files
